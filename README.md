In this project, we will create an online version of the famous game for children "Etch-A-Sketch".

It will display by default a 16x16 grid rendered dynamically by Javascript. Two buttons will be added to the interface: one to create a new grid with the number of squares chosen from 1 to 100 by the user and another button to clear the board.
Upon hovering the user will be able to draw what he wants, replicating the real game.
